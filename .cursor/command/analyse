analyze

1. Look into the user's input (look at tha chat/conversation's previous context and keep that in mind when moving forward)
2. assess the request against the project's codebase
3. do a comprehensive analysis of the request in relation to the codebase, prioritising code related to the user's prompt
4. propose no less than 3 plans of action (where applicable)
5. give a summary of what the potential pros and cons are for each plan of action (where applicable)
6. without deviating from the request AND context, make recommendations (if there are any).
7. do not execute on any code. Only give feedback.
