modify a existing feature ...

1. Do a deep dive on the feature(s)'s existing implementation first (look at tha chat/conversation's previous context and keep that in mind when moving forward).
2. Check to see if you understand the feature(s)'s structure and how everything related is connected.
3. Look at the requirements and objectives that the user mentioned in the prompt.
4. Understand the flow of data, information, variables shared and private, and assess the request.
5. Ask any clarifying questions before executing on any plan of action.
6. The plan of action should include classes/methods/functions with their respective related classes/methods/functions/variables and some explanation of how this achieves the goal desired.
7. Execute the plan of action step by step prompting the user on whether or not this was what they were looking to achieve at each stage.
8. Make readjustements based on user feedback and keep tieing each stage to the main objective. Keep in mind code cohesiveness.
9. Do not waste tokens or requests where instructions are clear.
